# SearchKings Front End Developer Exam

## Project Brief

* You are tasked with producing an HTML version of the mockup, filename: `dev-test-mockup-figma.fig`.
* The page should be responsive to all common screen sizes (using Bootstrap breakpoints are fine). No mobile or tablet mockup is provided, feel free to use your discretion on how elements on the page responds at a certain viewport.
* "Pixel perfection" is **not** a requirement, but it should look as close to the mockup as reasonably possible.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) should be used as the base css framework.
* Feel free to submit your work even if you do not finish all the tasks, as you will be evaluated on your approach to solving the challenges presented by the mockup, along with code quality, and not by quantity. This means that finishing a section perfectly is preferred over having multiple half-finished sections. However, we'd also like to note that the more sections you finish, the more code samples we'd have to accurately assess your performance.

## Starting Development

* Mockup files in Figma format is available in the `assets` folder. (If you do not have Figma installed in your machine, you can either download and install the application from the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) website or create an account and open the file in the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) website itself.)
* For your convenience, [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Google Material Symbols](hhttps://fonts.google.com/icons) libraries have already been added to the `index.html` file.
* The Navigation and Branch Locator sections have some helpful tips added to the `index.html` file to assist you in completing these sections.

# When You're Finished Both Parts
* Zip up the finished project. (Make sure you compress to a .zip format and not other formats.)
* Send the zip file back to the person who provided you this assignment
